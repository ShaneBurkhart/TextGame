doesUsernameExists function needs add.
New username needs to check for error codes as well as if username exists

Check for internet or data connection.

Verify that all login screens handle errors and positive outcomes.  Ex. Error codes.
Consolidate error codes down to a few.  0 = false ; -1 = error ; >0 = success;
Should work for all situations.  Error output should be something along the lines of could not contact server
or server is down.  User doesn't need to know what is happening.  

Consolidate buttons to click listeners and a single ShaneButton Class.  Will make it a lot less messy when
adding buttons to something like dialog.  Similar to the way loading dialog class works with the callback.
